# Introduction to React and Components
## Component Based Architecture

### 1. What are Components?
A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. 
### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?
Reusability − Components are designed to be reused in more than one project.

Replaceable − they can be replaced by better integrated components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended to perform a new task or an improved one.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
### 3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
Many, some of them are: More reliable, easily reusable, easier to develop, and usually reduced costs.
