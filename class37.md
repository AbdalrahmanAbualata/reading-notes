# REST
## Who is Roy Fielding?
* Some guy. He’s smart. :P He’s one of the makers and authors of REST.

 

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* Because they weren’t designed to be used like that, and as such they fail.

 

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* It’s about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

 

## What does a GET do?
* It requests data from a server.

 

## What does a POST do?
* It tries to add something to another system or server (data or otherwise).

 

## What does PUT do?
* This one replaces some data in another system.

 

## What does PATCH do?
* same as put, but instead of sending the whole dataset, you only send what you want to change.
