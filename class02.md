## Text in **HTML**
### Headings
* there is six level of heading in **HTLM** from h1 to h6 .
* **h1** is used for main headings , **h2** is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
**h3** element is used, and so
on...

* Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes , starting from **h1** is the biggest one then going to be smaller until **h6** .
### Paragraphs 
* To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening **< p >**
tag and closing **</ p >** tag.
* By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.
### **Bold** & ***Italic***
* The worlds between this tags  **< b >** and **</ b >** can make characters appear **bold**.
* The worlds between this tags  **< i >** and **</ i >** can make characters appear ***Italic***.
### Superscript & Subscript
* The **< sup >** element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power. 
* The **< sub >** element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas .
### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
* **There are a few elements that
do not have any words between
an opening and closing tag. They
are known as empty elements like ***(< br/ > and < hr / >)***
and they are written differently.**

* if you wanted <br/>
to add a line break <br/> inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag **< br / >**.
* To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the **< hr />** tag.<hr/>
   <hr/>
