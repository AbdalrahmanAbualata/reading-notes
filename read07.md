 # Expressions
 * An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
 * The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

* The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable.

 ## Operators 
 * In computer science, an operator is a character or characters that determine the action that is to be performed or considered. 
 * There are three types of operator that programmers use:
 1. arithmetic operators :- ( **+**	Addition ,
**-**	Subtraction ,** * ** Multiplication ) .
 
 2. logical operators :- (  **&&**	logical and ,
 , **||**	logical or  , **!**	logical not ).

 3. relational operators or Comparison Operators :-
 ( **==**	equal to , **>**	greater than , ** ?**	ternary operator ) .

## Loops and iteration
* Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return **true** or **false** when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns **false** . 
* The three most common types of loops are :-
1. for
2. while
3. do while
