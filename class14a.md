# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Managemen. 
## THE WORK ISSUE: REIMAGINING THE OFFICE

* Failure to Lunch

## The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’

* the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

1- Psychological safety:

* Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

2- Dependability:

* Everyone completes quality work on time.

3- Structure and clarity:

* Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

4- Meaning:

* Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

5- Impact:

* Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
# Transforms
* With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property. The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values. Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.
## Transform Syntax
* the transform property followed by the value.
* Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses

       div {

          webkit-transform: scale(1.5);

          moz-transform: scale(1.5);

          o-transform: scale(1.5);

          transform: scale(1.5); }


## 2D Transforms
* Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.
## Transitions & Animations:

* the ability to design interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash.

* There are four transition related properties in total, including :

* transition-property
* transition-duration
* transition-timing-function
* transition-delay.
## 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS:

1- Fade in: It’s a way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

2- Change color: Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.

3- Grow & Shrink: you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding.

4- Rotate elements

5- Square to circle: transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa.

6- 3D shadow

7- Swing

8- Inset border
