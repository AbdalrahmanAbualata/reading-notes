# Stacks and Queues
## What is a Stack?
A data type with a limited place for nodes. It works with a special mechanism for adding or removing elements like FILO and LIFO Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO).

 The functionality uses the pop and push methods, The pop method removes nodes whereas the push method adds nodes.

When we add a node into a stack, it will take the top, the top variable should be updated anytime we add or remove a node. 

## What is a Queue? 

A data structure that follows a First In First Out (FIFO) order, but the criteria differ in removing nodes.  inserting data is called enqueue, while removing data is called dequeue.
