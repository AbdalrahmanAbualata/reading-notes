Description
### exampel for HTML Structure 
* **</html>**
 * **<head>**
* **<title>**This is the Title of the Page**</title>**
* **</head>**

**<title>** tags will appear in the
title bar (or tabs) at the top of
the browser window
* Anything written between
the **<body>** tags will appear

## Extra Markup
### Comments in HTML
- If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
**<!-- comment goes here -->**
### ID Attribute
* Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
### Class Attribute
* Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.
### Block Elements
* Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements, Examples of block elements are
**<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.**
### Inline Elements
* Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements, Examples of inline elements are
** <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>**.
### iframe
* An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
### Escape Characters
* There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example,** ©** ,**<**, **¥**  , ** etc **...... .)
* If you want these
characters to appear on your
page you need to use the escape codes or
entity references like (**© =  & copy;**).
