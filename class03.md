# HTML
## Lists
*  **There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types :**

1. **Ordered lists < ol >** : are lists where each item in the list is
numbered.
    * Each item in the list is placed
between an opening **< li >** tag
and a closing **</ li >** tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
<hr>

2.  **Unordered lists < ul >**: are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
    *    Each item in the list is placed
between an opening **< li >** tag
and a closing **</ li >** tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
<hr>

3.  **Definition lists < dl >** : are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
* Inside the **< dl >** element you will
usually see pairs of **< dt >** and
**< dd >** elements.
     * **< dt >**
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
    *  **< dd >** 
This is used to contain the
definition.
## Boxes
### boxes dimensions
* By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the **height** and
**width** properties.
* The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
### Limiting Width
* Some page designs expand and
shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.
### Limiting Height
* In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
### Overflowing Content
* The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
    * **hidden (overflow: hidden)**
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box. 
    * **scroll (overflow scroll)**
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.
### Border, Ma rgin & Padding
 * Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
    1. Border :Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.
    2. Margin :Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
    3. Padding:Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

### Border Width
* The border-width property
is used to control the width
of a border. The value of this
property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the
following values:(thin,medium,
thick).
### border style 
* You can control the style of a
border using the **border-style**
property. This property can take
the following values:**(solid,dotted,groove,double,etc...).**
* You can individually change the
styles of different borders using:
1. border-top-style
2. border-left-style
3. border-right-style
4. border-bottom-style
### border color
* using **border-color** You can specify the color of a
border using either RGB values,
hex codes or CSS color names
* It is possible to individually
control the colors of the borders
on different sides of a box using:
1. border-top-color
2. border-right-color
3. border-bottom-color
4. border-left-color
### Shorthand
 * **border** :The border property allows you
to specify the width, style and
color of a border in one property
(and the values should be coded
in that specific order)
**border: 3px dotted #0088dd;** .
