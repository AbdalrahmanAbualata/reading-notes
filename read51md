# Spring MVC
- MVC stands for => Model View Controller.
- a Java framework for building web applications .

## How it works:
- Create a Web Controller
- create HTML page to show our data

## Create a Web Controller
* Controller: A controller contains the  logic of an application.It prepares a model map with data and selecting a view to be rendered.
* view : every thing the html contain and we want to show or render in our web applecation .
* Controller control HTTP requests.
* we are using **RequestParam** to assigne the value from query to varibles or parameter for the method we have in the controller.
* when we implement our method the Thymeleaf (is a Java library) transfer  to template files in order to display data text produced by our applications .

* in another word after we are writing our code and set the parameters for our method in controler if we implement our applicatin the Thymeleaf will create a template that look like Html .

## Spring Boot Devtools
* its like nodemon in node.js it let us testing our code without restert our applecation every time .
## Build an executable JAR
* you can build your application using Gradle or  JAR file .
## Add a Home Page
* in spring boot we can use html ,js and css for Static resources 
so we can create HTML page for our home page .

## Spring MVC and Thymeleaf
### Using Spring MVC will require:

1- Spring model attributes:first we need to add attribute to Model .

2- Request parameters:send the parameters to the server from the frontend.

3- Session attributes:
add mySessionAttribute

4- ServletContext attributes
The ServletContext attributes are shared between requests and sessions. In order to access ServletContext attributes in Thymeleaf you can use the #servletContext.

5- Spring beans.
