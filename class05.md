## Images
* 95 IMAGES
There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.

### Choosing Images for Your Site
* A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.
* If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

### Adding Images
* **< img >** To add an image into the page
you need to use an **< img >**
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
    1. **src**
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.
    2. **alt**
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it. 
    * You can also use the **title**
attribute with the **< img >** element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.
### Height & Width of Images
* **height**
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels. 
* **width**
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
### Where to Place Images in Your Code
 1. before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2.  inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3.  in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.
### Tools to Edit & Save Images
* There are several tools you can use to edit and
save images to ensure that they are the right
size, format, and resolution .
    * Adobe
Photoshop
     * PaintShop Pro
### ImageDi mensions
* The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.
### Image Resolution
* Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

## Color

### Foreground Color
* **color** the color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
    1. **rgb values**
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
     2. **hex codes**
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80 .
    3.**color names**
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan.

### Background Color
* background-color : CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.
* You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names.

### CSS 3: Opacity
* CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).
* The CSS3 rgba property allows
you to specify a color, just like
you would with an RGB value,
but adds a fourth value to
indicate opacity. This value is
known as an alpha value and is
a number between 0.0 and 1.0
(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The
rgba value will only affect the
element on which it is applied
(not child elements).
