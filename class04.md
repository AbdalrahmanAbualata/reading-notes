# HTML 
## LINKS
* Links are created using the **< a >** element. Users can click on anything
between the opening **< a >** tag and the closing **< /a>** tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the **href** attribute.
### Rela tive URLs
* Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.
### Email Links
* mailto:To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the **< a >**
element. However, this time the
value of the **href** attribute starts
with **mailto:** and is followed by
the **email address** you want the
email to be sent to.
### Opening Links in a New Window
* **target** :If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
**target attribute** on the opening
**< a >** tag. The value of this
attribute should be **"_blank"** .

## Layout
### Building Blocks
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
* **Block-level boxes** start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout **(< h1 > < p > < ul > < li >)**.

* **inline boxes** flow between surrounding text **(< img > < b > < i >).
### Containing Elements
* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element like **(< div > < section> )**.
* A box may be nested inside
several other block-level
elements. The containing
element is always the direct
parent of that element.
### Controlling the Position of Elements 
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function.
