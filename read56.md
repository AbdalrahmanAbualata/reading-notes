## What is Authorization?
- Authorization happens after a userâ€™s identity has been successfully authenticated. 
- It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources like database, funds, and other critical information to get the job done.


* The safety app consists of two parts: who you are and the license that allows you to do it.
* It is a framework for credibility, control, access and customizability that is the de facto standard for Spring applications
And Spring Security finds the primary choice for implementing security at the application level
Spring, in general, is intended to provide a highly customizable way to implement authentication
The main interface we use is AuthenticationManager and SpringBot provides a virtual tool with only one user
After the authentication is successful, a special program for the same branch moves to the authorization of its main interface
Spring Security relies on filters. There are multiple applications of filters that play a large role, especially though they are presented by their container as a single filter.

* The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
